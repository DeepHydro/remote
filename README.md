Satellites
----------


### Landsat

The Landsat program hosts the longest record of images collected of the Earth in existence. 
- The program has so far consisted of the eight missions, beginning in 1972 with the Launch of Landsat 1. 
- Landsat 3 introduced a fifth, thermal band. 
- Landsat 4 introduced the Thematic Mapper, which consisted of 7 bands and a 30m resolution.
- Landsat 5 was in most ways similar to 4.
- Landsat 6 failed to achieve orbit.
- Landsat 7 introduced an improved thermal sensor and a panchromatic band. In 2003, it's scan-line corrector failed, yielding heavily banded images.
- Landsat 8 was launched in 2013, capturing 11 bands.
- Landsat 9 is scheduled to launch in 2023.

Since 2008, Landsat data has been publically available making it a staple for many remote-sensing workflows.

- [InSARap](http://insarap.org/)


### ASTER

The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) is one of a number of instruments on board the Terra platform, which was launched in December 1999. ASTER provides fourteen spectral bands with 15- to 90-meter resolutions depending on the band(s). ASTER does not acquire data continuously; its sensors are activated only to collect specific scenes upon request.

### VIIRS

VIIRS, a scanning radiometer, collects visible and infrared imagery and radiometric measurements of the land, atmosphere, cryosphere, and oceans. VIIRS data is used to measure cloud and aerosol properties, ocean color, sea and land surface temperature, ice motion and temperature, fires, and Earthâ€™s albedo. Climatologists use VIIRS data to improve our understanding of global climate change.

### OCO-2

### ISS-RapidScat


The ISS-RapidScat instrument is a speedy and cost-effective replacement for NASA's QuikScat Earth satellite, which monitored ocean winds to provide essential measurements used in weather predictions, including hurricane monitoring. So essential were QuikScat's measurements that when the satellite stopped collecting wind data in late 2009, NASA was challenged to quickly and cost-effectively conceive of a replacement. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the agency's station program came up with a solution that uses the framework of the International Space Station and reuses hardware originally built to test parts of QuikScat to create an instrument for a fraction of the cost and time it would take to build and launch a new satellite.
